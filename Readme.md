# Image Resizing with OpenCV and Custom Implementation

## Overview
This project resizes an image using OpenCV's `cv::resize` function with different interpolation methods and implements a custom resize function. It measures the performance of both OpenCV and custom implementations.

## Dependencies
- OpenCV
- C++11 or later

## Building the Project
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
